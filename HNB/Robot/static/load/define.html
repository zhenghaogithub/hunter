First we present some necessary definitions.  A {\it Steiner triple system} of order $v$, denoted
by STS$(v)$, is a pair $(X, {\cal B})$, where $X$ is a $v$-set and
${\cal B}$ is a collection of triples (called {\it blocks}) of $X$
such that every pair of $X$ is contained in a unique block of ${\cal B}$. Let $(X, {\cal B})$ be an STS$(v)$.

</p>

<p>
 If there exists a partition
$\Gamma=\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_{(v-1)/2}\}$ of ${\cal B}$ such that
each part $P_i$ forms a {\it parallel class}, i.e. a partition of
$X$, then the STS$(v)$ is called {\it resolvable} and $\Gamma$ is
called a {\it resolution}. A resolvable STS$(v)$  is usually called
a {\it Kirkman triple system} of order $v$, briefly by KTS$(v)$. It is
well known that a  KTS$(v)$ exists if and only if $v\equiv 3$ (mod
6) (see \cite{kts}).
</p>


<p>
  Two STS($v$)s on the same set
$X$ are said to be {\it disjoint} if they have no triples in common.
A set of $v-2$ pairwise disjoint STS($v$)s on the same set $X$ is
called a {\it large set} of STS($v$)s and denoted by LSTS($v$).
  A large set of
Kirkman triple systems of order $v$, denoted by LKTS$(v)$, is an
LSTS$(v)$ where each STS$(v)$ is resolvable.
